# 3D Filament Dryer
 Heats and dries wet filaments to improve print quality and longevity.
 
The purpose of this project is to build a dehumidifier with Arduino modules such as humidity and temperature sensors, mosfets and rep rap printer heatbeds.

Due to limitations in the RAM memory of the Arduino Nano, the Raspberry Pi Pico was chosen, which also increases the flash to 2 MBytes.


Temperature control
-------------------
The temperature control module is based on the [QuickPID](https://github.com/Dlloydev/QuickPID) library which has an advanced anti-windup mode which prevents deep saturation and reduces overshoot.

The task of calculating the PID constants is based on the same author's [sTune](https://github.com/Dlloydev/sTune) library which uses an open-loop PID auto-tuner using a novel s-curve kneepoint test method.
