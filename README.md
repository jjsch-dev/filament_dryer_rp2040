# 3D Filament Dryer
 Heats and dries wet filaments to improve print quality and longevity.
 
The purpose of this project is to build a dehumidifier with Arduino modules such as humidity and temperature sensors, mosfets and rep rap printer heatbeds.

Due to limitations in the RAM memory of the Arduino Nano, the Raspberry Pi Pico was chosen, which also increases the flash to 2 MBytes.
